## 2 Data Inputs <a class="anchor" id="2"></a>
**Data Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/

**Data Description**: 
* A large number of histopathological images for classification.  
* The original PCam dataset had duplicates, but this Kaggle dataset removed them, cleaning it up.  
* If a label is 0 then it is *begin*, or 1 is *malignant*.  
* The positive label is only associated with the 32x32 px region in the center of each tissue sample image.
